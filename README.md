Simple Password Cracker by Andy Glenn written in BASIC

Here is a simple password cracker written in BASIC. It's only intended for fun and learning purposes.

The code performs a brute force hack against your chosen password. You have the option to filter on Uppercase, Lowercase, Numerics and Special Characters (Punctuation). The code compares password guess attempts against a guess history array. This has been dimensioned for 1 Million values, but can be changed as required to suit your system resources.

You are free to use and modify the code for your own purposes.
